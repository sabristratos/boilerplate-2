# Form System Improvement Tasks

A checklist of actionable improvements for the form system. Each item can be checked off as completed.

1. [ ] Add inline documentation and docblocks to all public methods in form-related Livewire components and services for better maintainability.
2. [ ] Refactor form element rendering logic to ensure consistency and easier extension for new element types.
3. [ ] Implement more granular validation error messages for each form field, including custom messages per rule.
4. [ ] Add support for conditional logic (show/hide fields based on other field values) in the form builder.
5. [ ] Improve the UI/UX of the form builder with drag-and-drop reordering and clearer element selection states.
6. [ ] Add autosave or draft-saving functionality to prevent data loss during form editing.
7. [ ] Ensure all user-facing strings in forms and form builder are translatable and use Laravel's translation helpers.
8. [ ] Add bulk actions for managing form submissions (delete, export, mark as read, etc.) in the admin panel.
9. [ ] Implement export functionality for form submissions (CSV, Excel, JSON) for client data portability.
10. [ ] Add audit logging for form edits and submissions for better traceability.
11. [ ] Review and optimize database queries in FormService for performance, especially on large datasets.
12. [ ] Add unit and feature tests for form creation, editing, submission, and validation edge cases.
13. [ ] Ensure accessibility (a11y) best practices in all form-related frontend components.
14. [ ] Add support for file upload fields with validation and secure storage.
15. [ ] Provide a way to duplicate forms and form elements for faster creation of similar forms.
16. [ ] Add a preview mode for forms as they will appear on the frontend, directly in the builder.
17. [ ] Implement rate limiting or spam protection (e.g., honeypot, reCAPTCHA) for public form submissions.
18. [ ] Allow for customizable success and error messages per form.
19. [ ] Add versioning or revision history for forms to allow rollback to previous states.
20. [ ] Review and update all DTOs for strict type safety and validation coverage.
