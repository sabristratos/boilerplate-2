# Form Builder System Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of tasks to improve the form builder system. Each task is designed to enhance functionality, fix issues, improve user experience, or ensure code quality and consistency.

## Architecture and Data Model

1. [x] Add missing fillable properties to the Form model to prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities

3. [x] Implement proper handling of field options for select/radio/checkbox fields (currently stored as plain text)
4. [x] Add support for field groups/sections to organize complex forms
5. [x] Implement a proper field ordering system using the existing Sortable trait
6. [x] Create a FormFieldValidator class to centralize validation logic
7. [ ] Add support for conditional fields (show/hide based on other field values)
8. [ ] Implement a plugin system for custom field types
9. [ ] Add support for file uploads in form submissions
10. [ ] Create a FormSubmissionExporter to export submissions to CSV/Excel

## Form Builder UI

11. [ ] Add drag-and-drop reordering of form fields
12. [ ] Implement a locale switcher in the form builder UI
13. [ ] Add more field types (email, number, date, time, checkbox, radio, file, etc.)
14. [ ] Improve the field options editor for select/radio/checkbox fields to support value/label pairs
15. [ ] Add a preview mode that shows the form as it would appear on the frontend
16. [ ] Implement field duplication functionality
17. [ ] Add support for field descriptions in addition to labels and placeholders
18. [ ] Create a form template system to quickly create common form types
19. [ ] Add form validation preview in the builder UI
20. [ ] Implement a form settings panel for advanced configuration options

## Form Display and Submission

21. [ ] Fix the select field options rendering (currently assumes array but stored as string)
22. [ ] Add client-side validation using Alpine.js or similar
23. [ ] Implement honeypot fields and other anti-spam measures
24. [ ] Add rate limiting for form submissions
25. [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback during submission
26. [ ] Implement a configurable success page/message after submission
27. [ ] Add support for redirecting to a specific URL after submission
28. [ ] Create a submission confirmation step for important forms
29. [ ] Implement form analytics to track submission rates and errors
30. [ ] Add support for saving form progress (for multi-step forms)

## Error Handling and Validation

31. [ ] Implement more granular validation rules for different field types
32. [ ] Add custom validation error messages per field
33. [ ] Improve error display in the form display component
34. [ ] Add server-side validation for all form builder inputs
35. [ ] Implement proper error handling for email notifications
36. [ ] Add validation for field names to ensure they're unique within a form
37. [ ] Create a validation rule builder UI in the form builder
38. [ ] Implement cross-field validation rules (e.g., "field A must be greater than field B")
39. [ ] Add support for custom validation rules
40. [ ] Improve logging for form submission errors

## Code Quality and Consistency

41. [ ] Fix the inconsistency between 'sort_order' in FormBuilder.php and 'order' in the FormField model
42. [ ] Standardize error message display across all form components
43. [ ] Add comprehensive PHPDoc comments to all form-related classes and methods
44. [ ] Create unit and feature tests for the form builder system
45. [ ] Refactor the FormBuilder component to use form requests for validation
46. [ ] Implement proper type hinting throughout the form builder code
47. [ ] Extract form rendering logic to a dedicated service class
48. [ ] Standardize the naming conventions across all form-related files
49. [ ] Add proper authorization checks to all form submission endpoints
50. [ ] Implement consistent translation handling across all form components

## User Experience Enhancements

51. [ ] Add form field tooltips to provide additional context to users
