Define roles and permissions clearly in your application, preferably within a database seeder.
Use Policies for fine-grained access control on your models to keep authorization logic organized.
Regularly audit roles and permissions to ensure security and remove unused definitions.
Implement caching for performance improvements on permission checks, especially in high-traffic applications.
Use Blade directives like @role and @permission for clean and readable authorization checks in your views.
