Use the HasTranslations trait in your models for easy access to translations.
Store translations in a JSON column for better performance and a simpler database structure.
Implement fallback languages for a seamless user experience when a translation is missing.
Use the setTranslation and setTranslations methods for updating single or multiple translations.
Leverage route model binding with translated slugs for SEO-friendly, localized URLs.
