description: Best practices for Livewire and Alpine.js components

Keep components stateless when possible for easier testing and predictability.
Use wire:model for two-way data binding, but optimize with .defer or .lazy to reduce network requests.
Communicate between components using Livewire's event system for parent-child and sibling component interactions.
Utilize Livewire's lifecycle hooks for running code at specific points in a component's lifecycle (e.g., mount, updating, updated).
Leverage Alpine.js for rich client-side interactivity by using $wire to communicate with Livewire.
Keep simple Alpine.js logic directly in Blade files; extract more complex logic to a dedicated JavaScript file.
