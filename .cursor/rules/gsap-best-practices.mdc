description: Best practices for GSAP animations

Use timelines for complex animations to maintain control over sequences and timing.
Optimize performance by applying the will-change CSS property to elements that will be animated.
Leverage GSAP's built-in easing functions for smoother and more natural transitions.
Keep animations modular and reusable by creating functions that return GSAP timelines.
Integrate with Alpine.js using x-init to start animations and $watch to trigger them when data changes.
