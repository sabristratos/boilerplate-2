description: Best practices for Tailwind CSS v4 styling
Configure your theme directly in your main CSS file using the @theme at-rule instead of tailwind.config.js.
Use a single @import "tailwindcss"; in your CSS; content path configuration is now automatic.
For Vite projects, use the official @tailwindcss/vite plugin for the best performance.
Leverage dynamic utility values like w-17 or grid-cols-15 directly, avoiding the need for arbitrary value syntax.
Utilize the new P3 color palette for more vivid colors on modern displays.
Use native CSS variables (e.g., var(--color-avocado-500)) exposed by the @theme block for custom CSS or inline styles.
Implement container queries directly with the core @container and @<breakpoint>: variants.
Use modern CSS features like color-mix() for opacity (e.g., bg-blue-500/50).
Create entry and exit transitions without JavaScript using the new starting: variant.
Apply styles conditionally with the not-* variant, which supports selectors, media, and feature queries.
Use expanded gradient APIs like bg-conic-* and bg-radial-* for advanced effects.
Take advantage of new core utilities for 3D transforms, field-sizing, and color-scheme.
